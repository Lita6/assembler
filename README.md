I'm going to follow along with Handmade Hero. Not only am I going to follow along, but I'm also going to write my own game. I'm going to write it in assembly. Not just any assembly; I'm going to write the assembler as I go, too. As new functionality pops up on Handmade Hero, I'll extend the assembler.

I have no idea how far I'm going to get because this is nuts to try, but I really have to try.
